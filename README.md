# React Components

### What's that ? ###

a simple repo where i plan to post some react components i created

### How to try it ? ###

## If you want to modify src ##
First thing first, install all package with :
` npm install `

If you modify src dont forget to use grunt to rebuild everything with :
` grunt `
notice that i use watch plugin so you can launch it once and everytime you're gonna save files
every Sass files and Js files are gonna be rebuild automatically

## otherwise ##
To run it you could use Python server web, in your terminal go into the folder of the project :
`cd ~/react-components`

Once you're inside, use :
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

And then in your favorite browser go on ` http://localhost:8080 `
